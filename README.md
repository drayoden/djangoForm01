### django sandbox - just messing around...
---
- branches:
  - master - base working django install - NO html, db, views, forms, or templates. NOTE: /form/ is the base project folder (settings.py).
    - form.fetchAP - a soultion to using the fetchAPI with django, POST a form without page refresh!
    - gsap.sandbox - messing around with the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) JS library.
